How Git Works ?

- git init

Initializes git repository on a current directory

- git status

Shows the current status of the working tree

when you create/put a file in the directory, git treats it as an untracked file

- git add <file_name> 

used to make the new file tracked in the staging area

- git commit -m "Label to file"

used to commit file to the local repository, -m option can be used to give a label to the file

- gid add '*.txt'

wild card usage / adds all .txt files under any directory of the root

- git log
shows the journal of repository / commits etc

- git remote add origin https://github.com/dogusb/learn-git.git
adds remote repository https://github.com/dogusb/learn-git.git under the name origin

- git push -u origin master
The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. Pushes local branch to github

-git branch
lists all the branches

-git branch <newBranchName>
creates a new branch

-git checkout <newBranchName>
switching between branches
