How Git Works ?

- git init
Initializes git repository on a current directory

- git status
Shows the current status of the working tree

when you create/put a file in the directory, git treats it as an untracked file

- git add <file_name> 

used to make the new file tracked in the staging area

- git commit -m "Label to file"

used to commit file to the local repository, -m option can be used to give a label to the file
